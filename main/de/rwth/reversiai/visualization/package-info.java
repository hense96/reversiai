/**
 * The {@code visualization} package is a utility package that provides an easy-to-use way of visualizing game states.
 * These features are used for debugging the system and to allow human interaction with the client in order to play
 * against the AI.
 * <br>
 * <strong>Side note</strong>: A lot of the methods in this package look quite messy because they were developed rapidly
 * (as this is just a nice-to-have feature). We did not want to spend a lot of time refactoring the code in here so that
 * it looks nice since this is really not a part of the core system.
